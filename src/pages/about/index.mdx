## About the Club

The Combating Childhood Cancer Club, lovingly called C4, works to help children with cancer by aiding them economically, physically, and emotionally. This club was first founded at Poolesville High School in 2018 by Roma Dhingra, who was directly inspired to start this club after spending a summer volunteering at a pediatric oncology clinic. During the COVID-19 crisis, C4 is also sending weekly motivational notes to frontline workers. Check out our Support section to participate!

## Our Values and Goals

Fighting against cancer can be hard, physically and emotionally. The Combating Childhood Cancer Club aims to increase positivity among children battling cancer. We value community efforts and unity in order to help everyone thrive. We also value commitment and positive change as they go hand in hand. We need our volunteers to be dedicated to our mission by writing cards and fundraising in order to show patients that we love them and they shouldn’t give up!

## Organizations We Support

We donate new toys and money to Children’s National and St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital in order to support the young cancer patients at these hospitals. We also donate money to childhood cancer research conducted by the National Foundation for Cancer Research.
